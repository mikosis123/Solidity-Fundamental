<summary><strong>Key Characteristics of Blockchain</strong></summary>

- **Decentralization**: No central authority; operates on a peer-to-peer network.
- **Immutability**: Once recorded, data cannot be altered or deleted.
- **Transparency**: Transactions are publicly visible on the ledger.
- **Security**: Uses cryptographic encryption and hashing to ensure data integrity.
- **Consensus Mechanisms**:
  - **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Requires computational power to solve cryptographic puzzles and validate transactions. Example: **Bitcoin**.
  - **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: A mechanism where participants (validators) are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral Example: **Ethereum 2.0**.

<summary><strong>Types of Blockchains</strong></summary>

- **Public Blockchains**: Open to anyone, fully decentralized.
  - Example: **Bitcoin, Ethereum**.
- **Private Blockchains**: Restricted access, controlled by a single entity.
  - Example: **Hyperledger, Corda**.
- **Consortium Blockchains**: Partially decentralized, governed by multiple organizations.
  - Example: **R3 Corda (banking), Quorum (enterprise solutions)**.
