# Module 4: Introduction to Solidity & Smart Contracts

<details>
<summary><strong> Declaring Variables and Functions in Solidity</strong></summary>

- 📝 **Introduction to Solidity syntax**
- 🔢 **How to declare variables** (`uint`, `string`, `address`, `bool`)
- 🏗 **State variables vs. local variables**
- 🔧 **How to declare functions** in Solidity (`public`, `private`, `view`, `pure`)
- 🚀 **Writing a basic Solidity function** and deploying it in Remix

**💡 Interactive Task:**

- Use [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to write and test a simple Solidity contract.

<details>
<summary><strong> Variable Scope in Smart Contracts</strong></summary>

- 🔍 **Understanding where variables can be accessed** within a contract.
- 🏛 **Global, local, and state variables** in Solidity.
- 🧐 **Examples of scope limitations** and best practices.
- 🛠 **Debugging scope-related issues** in Solidity.

**💡 Interactive Task:**

- Modify a Solidity contract to include both global and local variables, then analyze their scope.

<details>
<summary><strong> How Visibility Specifiers Work</strong></summary>

- 👁 **Understanding Solidity visibility specifiers**: `public`, `private`, `internal`, and `external`.
- 🏗 **How visibility affects contract inheritance** and external interactions.
- ⚠ **Security considerations** when defining visibility.
- 📝 **Hands-on practice:** Writing functions with different visibility levels.

**💡 Interactive Task:**

- Analyze a real-world Solidity contract on [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) identify visibility specifiers used.
